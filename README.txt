1. Overview
The examples are organized into different projects by product feature.

2. Requirements
- Visual Studio, compatible with the supported .NET versions
- Minimum .NET Framework 4.5 or .NET Core 3.1. All projects target .NET Framework 4.5, however, the Target Framework from each project's properties can be changed to .NET Core 3.1.

3. Serial Key and EdiFabric trial DLLs
Download the serial key and EdiFabric trial DLLs from https://sowl.co/oApEt. 
The serial key is included in the file serial.key in folder edifabric-trial. Ensure it is there and that the file is not empty. The serial key is loaded in the file SerialKey.cs in project EdiFabric.Examples.EDIFACT.Common. 
Open the file and ensure that the serialKeyPath is correct. If the serial key is invalid or the file is missing, contact us at https://support.edifabric.com/hc/en-us/requests/new for assistance.
The trial DLLs are in folders net45 (for .NET Framework 4.5+) and netcoreapp3.1 (for .NET Core 3.1+).
